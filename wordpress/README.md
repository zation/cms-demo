# VagrantPress

*VagrantPress* is a packaged development environment for developing WordPress themes and modules.  I initially created this project to aid in developing child modules for a WordPress blog.

## Getting Started

This is a fairly simple project to get up and running.  The procedure for starting up a working WordPress is as follows:

1. Clone the project.  (There’s only master branch.)
2. Run the command `vagrant up`
3. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080

You’ll note that a copy of WordPress v. 3.5 has also been copied to the directory where you ran the `vagrant up` command - this is what is being served from the virtual environment.

To log in to the local Wordpress installation at http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/ the username is `admin`, the password is `vagrant`.

## A Few Details

* I’m running this on a local ‘box’ (working on importing this one to S3) of Ubuntu 12.04LTS 64-bit.  This might be a bit full blown for a development environment - feel free to edit the Vagrantfile to include any other box you may have.  (My goal is to get a ‘real’ box loaded to S3 so the install/run is seamless.)

* If you're needing a password (for anything - including mysql, it should be `vagrant`)

## UPDATES (June 2013)

* Thanks to some really great help, vagrantpress runs much faster.  We're using the release version of WordPress (instead of cloning the GitHub repository) and there are some sensible defaults added to the puppet scripts.
